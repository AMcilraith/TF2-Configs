#Tvde1's TF2 Configs

##Introduction
Hi!
These are my TF2 configs for all classes.
I'll try to comment on what every line does, if there are any questions, just ask.
Feel free to edit the configs to your own liking!


##Installation
You can download this GitHub repository as a .zip and extract all the files into `%YourSteamPath%\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Configs\`. You can delete readme.md though.
Also make sure you have no scripts in `\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg` that have the same name as these.
You should update it regularly, and scan through the keybinds to see if I have added something.

##Maps
As you can see, I have a few aliasses that start up maps. You can only use them if you've downloaded the maps.
Those maps are
- tr_walkway_rc2
- tr_aim
- tr_aim_practice
