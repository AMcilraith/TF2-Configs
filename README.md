#Tvde1's TF2 Configs

###Introduction
Hi!
These are my TF2 configs for all classes.
I'll try to comment on what every line does, if there are any questions, just ask.
Feel free to edit the configs to your own liking!


###Installation
You can download this GitHub repository as a .zip and extract all the files into `%YourSteamPath%\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Configs\cfg`
Also make sure you have no scripts in `\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg` that have the same name.


###Keybinds

####All classes:
| Button(s) | Function | Extras |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WASD | Regular movement | I have added a null-movement script. |
| SPACE | Jumps + Crouches | This button jumps and crouches at the same time when you hold the spacebar. |
| CTRL | Crouches | |
| SHIFT | Used for class-switching and voice commands | If you hold shift, you can use voice commands and class switching. |
