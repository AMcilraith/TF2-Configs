#Tvde1's TF2 Configs

##Introduction
Hi!
These are my TF2 configs for all classes.
I'll try to comment on what every line does, if there are any questions, just ask.
Feel free to edit the configs to your own liking!


##Installation
You can download this GitHub repository as a .zip and extract all the files into `%YourSteamPath%\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Configs\`. You can delete readme.md though.
Also make sure you have no scripts in `\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg` that have the same name as these.
You should update these to see if I have added stuff. There is a changelog down below.

##Changelog
Nothing yet.
