#Tvde1's TF2 Configs

###Introduction
Hi!
These are my TF2 configs for all classes.
I'll try to comment on what every line does, if there are any questions, just ask.
Feel free to edit the configs to your own liking!


###Installation
You can download this GitHub repository as a .zip and extract all the files into `%YourSteamPath%\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Configs\cfg`
Also make sure you have no scripts in `\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg` that have the same name.


###Keybinds

####All classes: (Some classes may overwrite these)
| Button(s) | Function | Extras |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WASD | Regular movement | I have added a null-movement script. |
| SPACE | Jumps + crouches | This button jumps and crouches at the same time when you hold the spacebar. |
| CTRL | Crouches | |
| SHIFT | Used for class-switching and voice commands | If you hold shift, you can use voice commands and class switching. |

| Mouse 1 | Attacks | Just the same as default |
| Mouse 2 | Uses attack2 | E.g. equipping an invisi-watch, or zooming in as sniper. |

| Mousewheel Up | Primary weapon | Equips the primary weapon. **NOTE: Some classes overwrite this**|
| Mousewheel Down | Secondary weapon | Equips the secondary weapon. **NOTE: Some classes overwrite this**|
| Mousewheel Click | Melee | Equips the melee weapon and keeps swinging it until let gone of. **NOTE: Some classes overwrite this**|


| E | Call for medic | I shouldn't have to explain this. |
| ALT | Call for spy | Just calls out that there is a spy. |
| F | Inspect | Inspects the player aimed at, or shows an animation of your current weapon. |

####Shift usage: (When shift is hold down)
| Button(s) | Function | Extras |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E | Yes! Voice | Says "Yes!" with a voice command. |
| R | No! Voice | Says "No!" with a voice command. |
| F | Thanks! Voice | Says "Thanks!" with a voice command. |
| 1 to 9 | Class switching | Press 1 - 9 to swich to the desired class. I advise you to use this and not the regular class swiching. |

When shift is released, all buttons will be bound to the previous binds.
